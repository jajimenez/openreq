# OpenReq

## Introduction

OpenReq is a REST API for managing incidents and requests in projects.

## Development

The `.devcontainer` directory contains configuration to develop the project in
Visual Studio Code with Docker and a *dev container*. See
[how to share your Git credentials with the *dev container*](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/sharing-git-credentials).

You can run the project locally by running this command from the `src` directory:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
